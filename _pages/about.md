I am a first-year PhD candidate at HKUST NLP Group, supervised by Professor Junxian He. I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in June 2024. My research focuses on natural language processing and machine learning, specifically LLM Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning, Hallucination in Vision-Language Models (VLM), and LLM truthfulness and Interpretability.
